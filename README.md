# ðŸš‘ Life Link: Bangalore Closest Ambulance Route Finder

## **Overview**
Life Link is an interactive web application designed to provide real-time assistance during medical emergencies. It identifies the closest available ambulance in Bangalore, calculates the shortest route to the emergency location, and provides an estimated time of arrival (ETA). Additionally, the app includes a **First Aid Instructions** feature, offering guidance for minor and severe emergencies.

The application leverages advanced geospatial and machine learning techniques to ensure accurate location mapping, efficient routing, and timely response.

## **Features**
### **1. Closest Ambulance Finder**
- Takes the **emergency address** as input.
- Locates the nearest ambulance using a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model based on geographic coordinates.

### **2. Route Optimization**
- Retrieves the road network of Bangalore from OpenStreetMap using the `osmnx` library.
- Computes the shortest route using **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm**.

### **3. Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)**
- Accounts for real-time road congestion based on the time of day.
- Dynamically adjusts the ambulance's speed to provide an accurate ETA.

### **4. Real-Time Map Visualization**
- Displays the shortest route on an interactive **folium map**.
- Highlights both the ambulanceâ€™s starting point and the emergency destination.

### **5. First Aid Instructions**
- Provides essential first aid guidance for various medical emergencies.
- Available throughout the user session for quick reference.
